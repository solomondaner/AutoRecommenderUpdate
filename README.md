# AutoRecommenderUpdate.
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created so an unlimited amount of SKUs can automatically be featured in current product recommenders. This function is part of the marketing family of functions in the RemixAutoML package. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The Output MD file shows examples using the function.
