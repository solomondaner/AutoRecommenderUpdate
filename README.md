# AutoRecommenderUpdate
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by automating a userâ€™s ability to update an entire product recommender with featured SKUs, without duplicating the same SKU per customer. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The RMD Output file contains the R Markdown code used to create the [HTML presentation](https://solomondaner.github.io/AutoRecommenderUpdate/) for this function.
