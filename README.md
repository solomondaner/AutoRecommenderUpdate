# AutoRecommenderUpdate.
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by allowing someone to automatically update a product recommender without the worry of duplicating the same product per customer. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The Output RMD file contains hardcoded data to run the function on and example output of different function scenerios.
