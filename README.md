# AutoRecommenderUpdate.
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created so an unlimited amount of SKUs can automatically be featured in current product recommenders. This function is part of the marketing family of functions in the RemixAutoML package. 

#### The repository has the R code showing the function and an output file showing examples of how this function can be used.
