# AutoRecommenderUpdate
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by automating a userâ€™s ability to update an entire product recommender with featured SKUs, without duplicating the same SKU per customer. 

#### The function source code and markdown file that was used to create this [HTML presentation](https://solomondaner.github.io/AutoRecommenderUpdate/) is in the R folder.
