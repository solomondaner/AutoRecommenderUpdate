# AutoRecommenderUpdate.
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created so someone can automatically feature an unlimited amount of SKUs in a current product recommender. AutoRecommenderUpdate is part of the marketing family of functions in the RemixAutoML package. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The Output MD file shows example output of different function scenerios. Click "raw" to see the data in tabular form.
