# AutoRecommenderUpdate
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by Saved labor costs by automating a userâ€™s ability to update an entire product recommender with featured SKUs, without duplicating the same SKU per customer. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The function output is presented as an html and it's corresponding link is found under the HTML Output folder. The RMD Output folder contains the R Markdown code used to create the HTML file.
