# AutoRecommenderUpdate
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by allowing someone to automatically update a product recommender without the worry of duplicating the same product per customer. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The function output is presented as an html. The link is found under the HTML Output folder. The RMD Output folder contains the R Markdown code used to create the HTML file.
