# AutoRecommenderUpdate.
### AutoRecommenderUpdate is an R based function that I created to save labor costs by allowing someone to automatically update a product recommender without the worry of duplicating the same product per customer. AutoRecommenderUpdate is part of the marketing family of functions in the RemixAutoML package. 

#### This repository shows the function source code in the AutoRecommenderUpdate R file. The Output MD file has hardcoded data,and example output of different function scenerios. Click "raw" to see the data in tabular form.
